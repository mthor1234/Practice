/*
 * Binary Heap is a Binary Tree with the following specifications:
 * 1) It’s a complete tree (All levels are completely filled except 
 * possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible). 
 * This property of Binary Heap makes them suitable to be stored in an array.
 
 * 2) A Binary Heap is either Min Heap or Max Heap. In a Min Binary Heap, the key
 *  at root must be minimum among all keys present in Binary Heap. The same property
 *  must be recursively true for all nodes in Binary Tree. Max Binary Heap is similar to Min Heap.
